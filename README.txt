This project was developed independently by Sydnni Ahlheim in 2018. 
The purpose is to show use of arrays, case switches, and logic skills. 
The app will let you input how many contestants this year and last, the difference
between the two, the contestants names and what talent they will show, 
calculates and prints out the total revenue brought in, and the summary of
how many contestants are doing each talent.
